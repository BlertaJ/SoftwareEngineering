The system of managing the data of students in high school.
-I will make a program, for managing the data of students in high school, the reason of choosing this topic is because in my home country there isn't a system like this, and all the grades, names, data of students are made in manual way, not elecronic, so I think that this program wouldn't be a waste of time for me.
-My program will have a login first, and there will be 3 types of login:
	-Admin
	-Student
	-Proffesor
-This will give the opportunity to profesors, login and put the grades of students.
-The admin will have the opportunity to add proffesors and students.

-The technology:
	-Programming language - JAVA
	-Tool - Eclipse
	-Framework - Javafx

Why Java and javafx ?
Java can be used to create complete applications that can run on a single computer or be distributed across servers and clients in a network.
JavaFX provides a rich set of graphics and media APIs with high-performance hardware-accelerated graphics and media engines to simplify development of immersive visual applications.
